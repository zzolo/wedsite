      <p>We have blocked out rooms in hotels, but these are filling up.  Do let us know if you have any problems finding a place to stay.  The following places are near where shuttles will run (see Transportation seciton below).</p>

      <ul>

We have reserved a block of rooms here; it should be under our names or Judy Tompke.</a></li>

      <h3>In the Twin Cities</h3>

      <div id="mapExtras-cities"></div>

      <p>We live in South Minneapolis.  There are few hotels in the City of Minneapolis besides downtown which can be a bit expensive.  The surrounding subrurbs have more hotels and cheaper prices.  We are very close to Richfield, MN.  Do let us know if you have any problems finding a place to stay.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>There are multiple, relatively cheap hotels <a href="http://www.mallofamerica.com/visit/hotels">near the Mall of America<a/> or around <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hotels+near+richfield%2C+mn&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US503&oq=hotels+near+richfield%2C+mn&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.6751j0j4&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8">Richfield, MN</a>.  It is not central to Minneapolis, but only 15 minutes from where we live.</li>
        <li>There are a number of <a href="http://www.hotels.com/de1410652/hotels-minneapolis-minnesota/">hotels in downtown Minneapolis</a> but these can be expensive.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are lots of things to do in the Twin Cities:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Walker Art Museum</li>
        <li>Mill City Museum</li>
        <li>Science Museum of Minnesota</li>
        <li>See music at First Avenue</li>
        <li>... and much more</li>

      <h2>Transportation</h2>

      <h3>On the day of the wedding</h3>

      <p>Our goal is to make sure everyone has a good time, while still being safe and making sure there is no drinking and driving.  Please, please let us know if you intend to drink and don't have a ride; we will be happy to find you a ride.</p>

      <p>The following are the location for shuttles; please see the schedule and map for times and locations respectively.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mille Lacs Casino</strong>,</li>
        <li><strong>Izaty's resort</strong> (the south side of Mille Lacs Lake),</li>
        <li>and the <strong>Super 8 in Milaca</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Getting to central Minnesota</h3>

      <p>Unfortunately there is not good public transport to get from the Twin Cities to central Minnesota (around the wedding site).  We suggest you rent and share cars if possible.  If you are unable to rent a car, just want to save money, or otherwise can't find transport, please let us know and we can work something out.</p>
